# PRIMAVERA Identity Server Documentation

Welcome to the PRIMAVERA Identity Server documentation project.

Here you will find information about Identity and Access Management in general (including OAuth and OIDC), Identity Server's features and how to customize it for specific scenarios, and instructions for implementing authentication and authorization in the applications integrated with Identity Server.

It is a work in progress.

## Documentation Structure

The following chapters are available:

- [Architecture](arc/README.md) - the architecture in place for Identity Server and the technologies that drive its development.
- [Capabilities](capabilities/README.md) - reference documentation about Identity Server's capabilities.
- [How to](howto/README.md) - how to guides to integrate applications with Identity Server.
