# Capability - Hybrid Grant

> Tags: OAuth, OIDC, Authorization, Flow, Grant Type

The delegation grant type is an extension authorization grant flow supported by OAuth 2.0.

This grant type can be used to implement delegation, meaning that a middle-tier API can invoke a back-end API on behalf of the user (using a token obtained using one of interactive grant types) without allowing the user to invoke it directly.

> There are [samples](../samples/README.md) available to illustrate this grant type.
