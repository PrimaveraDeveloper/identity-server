# Capability - Hybrid Grant

> Tags: OAuth, OIDC, Authorization, Flow, Grant Type

The hybrid grant type is an authorization grant flow that is part of OAuth 2.0.

This grant type is adequate for client applications that run on a browser, typically with an authenticated user. It improves the implicit grant type with additional security.

> There are [samples](../samples/README.md) available to illustrate this grant type.
