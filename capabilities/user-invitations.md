# Capability - User Invitations

> Tags: Invitations, Users, Notifications

Any client application can invite users, using the Web API, to create their accounts on IDS so they can access that client application.

The invitation is sent on behalf of another existing user.

See: [Feature - User Invitations](/ref/features/user-invitations.md).
